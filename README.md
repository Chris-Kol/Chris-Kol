## Hello, World! I'm Christina 🖖 Welcome to my code playground!

### 🚀 About Me

Former mechanical engineer who fell in love with coding. Now I'm crafting digital solutions and sprinkling a bit of fun into the tech world.

### 💻 What I'm up to

🧙‍♀️ Conjuring code spells at [Epignosis](https://www.epignosishq.com) \
🎭 Moonlighting as the creator of [The Kollabs Chronicle](https://kollabs.dev/) - where tech meets giggles \
🎷 Occasional saxophone whisperer (my code has fewer bugs than my solos) \
🤖 Tinkering with AI in my spare time (teaching robots to laugh at my jokes)

### 🛠️ Tech Toolbox

PHP, JavaScript, Python, Rust (in progress) and an unhealthy obsession with memes about semicolons

### 🌈 Fun Fact

I once debugged a mechanical system and a software system on the same day. The software bug was easier to fix, but the mechanical one made for a better story!

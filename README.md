## Hello, World! I'm Christina 🖖

### About Me

Once a mechanical engineer, tinkering with physical wonders, I've evolved into a code-wielding magician. With a keen interest in technology, I've embarked on a journey that encompasses neural networks, melodic saxophone tunes, and the enchanting world of AI-generated bios.

### Experience

- 🔩 **Former Mechanic:** My journey began as a mechanical engineer, where I explored the intricacies of physical systems and structures.
- 🧠 **AI Enthusiast:** I delved into the fascinating world of neural networks and deep learning, channeling AI magic through R and Python for my diploma thesis.
- 🛒 **Ex-eCommerce Wizard:** I once held the scepter in the e-commerce realm, shaping user experiences and optimizing digital storefronts.
- 🤖 **Current Code Conjurer:** Today, I wield the wand of code as a Software Engineer at [@Epignosis](https://www.epignosishq.com/), crafting digital solutions that drive learning and growth.
- 🎷 **Saxophone Virtuoso:** When I'm not immersed in the world of programming, you can find me lost in the harmonious melodies of the saxophone, experimenting with melodic improvisations.
- 🚩 **CTF Raider:** As the sun sets on the workweek, I transform into a CTF Raider, relentlessly pursuing flags, crafting tunes, and even training GPT-3 for GitHub Bios. 🏴‍☠️🎵🤖

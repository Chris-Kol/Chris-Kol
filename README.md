## Hello, World! I'm Christina 🖖 Welcome to my code playground!

### 🔧 From mechanical to software
I used to be a mechanical engineer until coding won me over. Now I build digital solutions instead of physical ones.

### 💻 What I'm doing now
- Working as a developer at [Epignosis](https://www.epignosishq.com)
- Running [The Kollabs Chronicle](https://kollabs.dev/) - where tech meets giggles
- Playing saxophone badly (but enthusiastically)
- Messing around with AI projects in my free time

### 🛠️ Tech I use
PHP, Javascript/TypeScript, Python, Domain-Driven Design, and an unhealthy obsession with memes about semicolons.

### 💡 My approach
I'm big on writing testable code, using design patterns, and building maintainable solutions. I like to start with domain modeling before diving into implementation.

### 🌱 Learning
- Rust (it's kicking my butt, but I'm stubborn)
- Better ways to structure complex applications
- How to explain my job at family gatherings

### 🤝 Connect with me
Have an interesting project? Want to talk code? Just say hi?
